Best Pins to Use – ESP8266

One important thing to notice about ESP8266 is that the GPIO number 
doesn’t match the label on the board silkscreen. For example, D0 corresponds 
to GPIO16 and D1 corresponds to GPIO5.

The following table shows the correspondence between the labels on the 
silkscreen and the GPIO number as well as what pins are the best to use 
in your projects, and which ones you need to be cautious.

The pins highlighted in green are OK to use. The ones highlighted in yellow 
are OK to use, but you need to pay attention because they may have unexpected 
behavior mainly at boot. The pins highlighted in red are not recommended to 
use as inputs or outputs.
Label	GPIO	Input	Output	Notes

D0	GPIO16	no interrupt	no PWM or I2C support	HIGH at boot

used to wake up from deep sleep

D1	GPIO5	OK	OK	often used as SCL (I2C)
D2	GPIO4	OK	OK	often used as SDA (I2C)
D3	GPIO0	pulled up	OK	connected to FLASH button, boot fails if pulled LOW
D4	GPIO2	pulled up	OK	HIGH at boot

connected to on-board LED, boot fails if pulled LOW

D5	GPIO14	OK	OK	SPI (SCLK)
D6	GPIO12	OK	OK	SPI (MISO)
D7	GPIO13	OK	OK	SPI (MOSI)
D8	GPIO15	pulled to GND	OK	SPI (CS)

Boot fails if pulled HIGH

RX	GPIO3	OK	RX pin	HIGH at boot
TX	GPIO1	TX pin	OK	HIGH at boot

debug output at boot, boot fails if pulled LOW

A0	ADC0	Analog Input	X
