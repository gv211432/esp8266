[32m+[m[32m  TaskScheduler functionality (and size) for a specific purpose (sketch). This is achieved by defining specific[m[41m  [m

[32m+[m

[32m+[m[32m  (for approximately 1 ms, as the timer interrupt will wake it up), after what is determined to be an "idle" pass.[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32m  An Idle Pass is a pass through the task chain when no Tasks were scheduled to run their callback methods. This is[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32m  done to avoid repetitive idle passes through the chain when no tasks need to be executed. If any of the tasks in[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32m  the chain always requires immediate execution (aInterval = 0), then there will be no IDLE sleep between the task's[m[41m [m

[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mNOTE: Task Scheduler uses millis() (or micros()) to determine if tasks are ready to be invoked. Therefore, if you[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32m  put your device to any "deep" sleep mode disabling timer interrupts, the millis()`/micros()`** count will be[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32m  suspended, leading to an effective suspension of scheduling. Upon wake up, active tasks need to be re-enabled,[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32m  which will effectively reset their internal time scheduling variables to the new value of **millis()/micros().[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32m  Time spent in deep sleep mode should be considered "frozen", i.e., if a task was scheduled to run in 1 second[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32m  from now, and the device was put to sleep for 5 minutes, upon wake up, the task will still be scheduled 1 second[m[41m [m

[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mIn addition to time-only (``millis()/micros() only) invocation, tasks can be scheduled to wait on an event[m[41m [m
