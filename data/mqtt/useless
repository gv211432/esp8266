Many new APIs have adopted JSON as a format because it's built on the popular Javascript programming language, which is ubiquitous on the web and usable on both the front- and back-end of a web app or service. JSON is a very simple format that has two pieces: keys and values. Keys represent an attribute about the object being described. A pizza order can be an object. It has attributes (keys), such as crust type, toppings, and order status. These attributes have corresponding values (thick crust, pepperoni, and out-for-delivery).
